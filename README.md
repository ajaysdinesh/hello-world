My first steps
How I started my journey of programming. You never know what's coming up next in your life. Always loved writing, though not a good one. The typical nerd in school, with a knack for laziness. Life changed, late to realise why I never had deep friendships, the deepest relationship I had till this moment breaking up led me to this path.
